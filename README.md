# Introduction:
# Ronald Fisher was born in London, England on 17th February 1890.
# He was best known as a statistician and geneticist.
# He had achieved many groundbreaking discoveries in the fields of statistics and genetics in his career.
# This project will focus on his work with the Iris dataset.

# Background:
# In 1936 (at the age of 46), Fisher published a report titled "The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems" in the journal "Annals of Eugenics".
# Field research was carried out in the Gasp√© Peninsula, Quebec, Canada by Fisher's associate, Edgar Anderson.
# Three classes of Iris were collected and analysed all on the same day.
# The Iris dataset consists of 50 records for each of three classes of Iris flowers:
# 1. Iris setosa
# 2. Iris virginica
# 3. Iris versicolor
# Fisher had emphasised five distinct attributes from each sample taken:
# 1 & 2. Length & Width of the sepal
# 3 & 4. Length & Width of the petal
# 5. Species of Iris flower

# Analysis:
# By combining these four attributes, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model which helped to distinguish each class from one another.
# The discriminant function outlined that the morphological attributes of the class Iris setosa were very different in comparison to Iris virginica and Iris versicolor.
# Taking into account the differences between each attribute in each class of Iris, Fisher's discriminant function allowed the separation of each species in the form of statistics.

# Results:
# Histograms (bar charts) were used to display the results of Fisher and Anderson's research.
# These help display the differences between species clearly, via the discriminant method implemented by Fisher.

# Conclusion:
# Fisher's research of the Iris flower dataset went on to become the gold standard for many more statistical classification techniques for machine learning purposes.
# To assist analysts and scientists with data mining, it is important to note that all data has respective sources and backgrounds.
# Therefore, along with processing, analysing and interpreting recorded data, fields of data science can be improved upon by not only dealing with data, but also the subject matter behind the recorded data.
