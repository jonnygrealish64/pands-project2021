# Background:
# Ronald Fisher was born in London, England on 17th February 1890.
# He was best known as a statistician and geneticist.
# He had achieved many groundbreaking discoveries in the fields of statistics and genetics in his career.
# This project will focus on his work with the Iris dataset.

# Overview:
# In 1936 (at the age of 46), Fisher published a report titled "The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems" in the journal "Annals of Eugenics".
# Field research was carried out in the Gasp√© Peninsula, Quebec, Canada by Fisher and his associate, Edgar Anderson.
# Two of the three species of Iris were collected and analysed all on the same day.
# The Iris dataset consists of 50 records for each of three species of Iris flowers:
# 1. Iris setosa
# 2. Iris virginica
# 3. Iris versicolor
# Fisher had emphasised four distinct attributes from each sample taken:
# 1 & 2. Length & Width of the sepal
# 3 & 4. Length & Width of the petal
# By combining these four attributes, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model which helped to distinguish each species from one another.
